Step 1: Flash the modified FULL bin to your MSS54HP ECU to run the MSS54HP CSL software. If you desire to run the CSL flap, you will need to add an H-Bridge Chip to your ECU.

Step 2: Flash the desired partial binary for SMG or Manual. Feel free to play with the stock Partials in the Partials folder.
