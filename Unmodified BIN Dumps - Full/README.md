The MSS54 families (MSS54, MSS54HP, MSS54HP CSL) can run any software within the same family.

What this means is that should one want to upgrade (or downgrade for that matter), one can simply flash the full binary, NOT the partial, to your MSS54/HP/CSL.

NOTE: Looking for full binaries.

NOTE: Once the full binary is flashed, please flash the tune (or partial as it is known) of your choice back to match your needs.
